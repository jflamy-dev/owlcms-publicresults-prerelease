## OWLCMS Results Publisher (Prerelease Repository)

This application is meant to be installed on the cloud, to allow people anywhere on internet to see results from a competition.  

This program receives updates from the [OWLCMS](https://jflamy.github.io/owlcms4/#/index) program running at the competition site and updates its scoreboards based on those updates.  In this way, the program at the competition site does not have to sustain the load of many people looking at the results.

To install: click on this button.  You will be prompted to create a (free) account on the Heroku cloud if you do not have one already.  [Full instructions](https://jflamy-dev.github.io/owlcms4-prerelease/#/Remote) for how to connect your site to the cloud are available [here](https://jflamy-dev.github.io/owlcms4-prerelease/#/Remote).

> Note that if you are using a version labeled as "pre-release" from the Releases page of the `owlcms-publicresults-prerelease` repository, you should connect your Heroku Results Publisher to the `develop` branch (instead of `master` in order to perform updates).
